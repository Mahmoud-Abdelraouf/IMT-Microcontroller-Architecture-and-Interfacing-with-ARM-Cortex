# ARM Embedded Systems and IoT Course

Welcome to the ARM Embedded Systems and IoT Course! This repository contains the materials and code for a comprehensive course on embedded systems that covers ARM architecture basics, interrupts, real-time processing, audio processing, communications, IoT, and bootloader implementation.

## Course Outline

The course is divided into 7 chapters, with a total of 22 lectures. Here is an overview of the course outline:

### Chapter 1 - ARM Architecture Basics
- Lecture 1: ARM Architecture
- Lecture 2: RCC Peripheral
- Lecture 3: DIO Peripheral

### Chapter 2 - ARM Interrupts
- Lecture 4: NVIC
- Lecture 5: NVIC Driver
- Lecture 6: EXTI

### Chapter 3 - Real Time
- Lecture 7: SysTick
- Lecture 8: OS Scheduler
- Lecture 9: LED Matrix

### Chapter 4 - Audio Processing
- Lecture 10: DAC
- Lecture 11: Audible Signals

### Chapter 5 - Communications
- Lecture 12: Serial To Parallel
- Lecture 13: IR Communication
- Lecture 14: UART
- Lecture 15: SPI and TFT
- Lecture 16: DMA

### Chapter 6 - IoT
- Lecture 17: WiFi Module
- Lecture 18: Web Development
- Lecture 19: IoT

### Chapter 7 - Bootloader
- Lecture 20: Story of Flashing
- Lecture 21: Hex Parser
- Lecture 22: Bootloader Implementation

Each lecture is organized in a separate folder, containing the lecture slides, code examples, and exercises.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course, simply clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the desired lecture folder. Each lecture folder contains a `README.md` file with instructions on how to run the code examples and complete the exercises.

## Prerequisites

To complete the exercises and run the code examples, you will need the following:

- STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller
- Keil uVision 5 IDE/STM32CubeIDE
- STLink V2 Debugger
- USB to TTL Serial Converter
- WiFi Module (ESP8266)
