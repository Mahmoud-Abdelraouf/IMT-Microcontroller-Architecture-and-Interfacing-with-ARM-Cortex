# ARM Embedded Systems and IoT Course

Welcome to the ARM Embedded Systems and IoT Course! This repository contains the materials and code for a comprehensive course on embedded systems that covers ARM architecture basics, interrupts, real-time processing, audio processing, communications, IoT, and bootloader implementation.

## Course Outline

The course is divided into 7 chapters, with a total of 22 lectures. Here is an overview of the course outline:

Sure, here's the course outline presented in a table format:

Each lecture is organized in a separate folder, containing the lecture slides, code examples, and exercises.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course, simply clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the desired lecture folder. Each lecture folder contains a `README.md` file with instructions on how to run the code examples and complete the exercises.

## Prerequisites

To complete the exercises and run the code examples, you will need the following:

- STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller
- Keil uVision 5 IDE/STM32CubeIDE
- STLink V2 Debugger
- USB to TTL Serial Converter
- WiFi Module (ESP8266)
